				<h2>Ekonomija</h2>

				<p>It was a warm, southern-hemisphere spring day. A gentle breeze blew through the wide-open windows of the Palace, finally having the chance to clear out the stale air that had been trapped inside all winter. True, this winter had been warmer than most, bringing only dismal, dreary rain on days that should have ended with a blanket of angelic, powdery snow covering the palace grounds, but today just seemed… fresh. Like a new beginning.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>Just then there was a knock at the door of the suite. He took one more look around, noting the irony of a people engaged in a destructive war, all beneath a spring day that was striving to give life to the land. Turning, he stepped back into the room, feeling the chill of the still-cold floor through the soles of his shoes. Reaching the center of the room, he stopped. "Come in," he said.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The courtier did not even break stride. "I'm very sorry, but I've been forbidden from discussing anything with you, Professor." He then glanced around, making sure no one was nearby, and continued, lowering his voice to just above a whisper. "What would you like to know?"</p>
				<br/>
				<p>The ancient times, when the world and its inhabitants were created, is referred to as The Mythic Age. All the events described above happened in the Mythic Age. This era ended with an all-out war between the Primordial Twins, known as the Creation War, which was fought on all levels of reality.</p>
				<br/>
				<p>All three doors in the Tomb Entrance Area lead to this staircase maze, which is a series of chambers set one above the other, with the levels of the chambers alternating. They are set up in such a way that if the party takes the door to the right, and always chooses the right-most door afterward (which may be the striaght-ahead door or the left door, if no other doors are in the chamber), they will end up back where they started, but with the middle door to their right (as they exit the door they first went through).</p>
